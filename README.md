In this project, I wrote a program in Java Programming Language, in Visual Studio Code, to generate random passwords based on the characters the user wants to use and the length he chooses. 
The program also calculates the strength of the password it generated. The strength is displayed using some keywords like "weak", "medium", "good" or "great" and it depends on the length the user chose. A display menu is showed at the beggining of the output, after some basic information and instructions appear in the terminal. 

Keep in mind that I'm a beginner, but I tried my best.
I got this project idea and some indications from this link: https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/java-projects/ .
